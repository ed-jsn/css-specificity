  <h1>Basic CSS Specificity</h1>
    <h2>Linking to HTML</h2>
      <p>CSS can be written directly into a HTML document by writing inside style tags.
          However, it is preffered to use a separate .css file and link them in HTML using the link tag. 
          A common link tag looks like the following:</p>
          <span class="code">&lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;</span>
    <h2>Selectors</h2>
      <p>Selectors are resusable rulesets that operate CSS onto elements that fit their defined specificity.
          using body as the selector will effect all elements inside the body of the HTL document - unless they 
          have more specific declarations. Specifity always takes priority in styling a document.
      </p>
      <h2>Classes</h2>
      <p>Classes are used to name certain elements in HTML and effect them specifically with CSS. For instance,
        A h2 heading would be styled by a h2 declaration in HTML unless it had a specified class, which would override 
        any prior, wider, h2 settings. Classes are denoted by a . in CSS and are called in HTML in the opening tags of 
        an element.</p>
    <h2>Grouping Selectors</h2>
      <p>Selectors can be grouped in CSS using a comma, which will mean all grouped elements will be effected by the declaration
          unless they are given further specificity. Classes can be grouped with basic selectors.
      </p>
    <h2>Chaining Selectors</h2>
      <p>Similar to grouping selectors, selectors can be chained so that only certain combinations
          of classes and elements can be affected. For Instance, a h3 heading with a class of 'section-heading' (written in CSS as
          h3.section-heading {} ) can be affected specifically without affecting either the h2 element or the 'section-heading' 
          class overall.
      </p>
    <h2>ID Tags</h2>
      <p>ID tags are similar to classes except have further specifity. They are unique and each ID should only be used in one place
          in HTML at a time. They have higher specifity than classes and so will always take precedent over them. they are denoted 
          in CSS by a Hashtag in the declaration and are called in HTML with an ID="" in the opening tags of an element.
      </p>
    <h2>!important</h2>
      <p>With the heighest specifity overall, the !important rule is used in special circumstances to demand control over the style of an
          element. It should generally be avoided due to its power.
